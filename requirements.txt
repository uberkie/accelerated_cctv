# PyGObject and pycairo are provided by the OS on many distros and often
# fail to build in a pure pip environment because they need system libraries
# (cairo, gobject-introspection, etc). Install these via your package manager
# (see docs/requirements.md) or uncomment below if you know your environment
# can build them.
# PyGObject
# pycairo
# Notes: some dependencies require system packages (GStreamer, GTK/GObject introspection,
# NVIDIA drivers and CUDA for pycuda). See docs/requirements.md for install hints.
